# INTERNSHIP-AND-PROJECTS-IoT-
A collection of my internship and academic projects in Embedded Systems, IoT, and Edge AI — featuring real-time environmental monitoring, smart control systems, and on-device ML implementations. Includes multi-node ESP32/Arduino IoT networks, MQTT-based communication, PCB designs, TinyML anomaly detection, and system-level programming in C.
